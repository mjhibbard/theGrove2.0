                <p class="story-page-leader__card-copy">Andy’s passion is to encourage people to see that being in relationship with Christ
                makes them the person they were created to be.  He encourages people through getting
                to know them, and helping them learn more about the God who deeply desires a
                relationship with His creation.
                    Andy believes that people were created to FLOURISH, and as a founding pastor for
                    The Grove Community, his desire is to lead people into the fully devoted
                    relationship with Jesus that makes that abundant life possible.

                    Mike’s passion is to see people connect with Christ as they grow closer to one another.
                    As a co-founding pastor of The Grove, Mike has a passion to see growth in people who
                    were disconnected from God, and have now discovered what it means to be in
                    relationship with the One who created them.  Mike believes that Jesus changes
                    everything, and encourages our families at The Grove to be involved in spiritual
                    growth through small groups and in every aspect of their daily lives.

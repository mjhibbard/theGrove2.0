Andy Johnson - Lead Pastor

Andy’s passion is to encourage people to see that being in relationship with Christ makes them the person they were created to be.  He encourages people through getting to know them, and helping them learn more about the God who deeply desires a relationship with His creation.  Andy believes that people were created to FLOURISH, and as a founding pastor for The Grove Community, his desire is to lead people into the fully devoted relationship with Jesus that makes that abundant life possible.

Mike Holbrook - Associate Pastor

Mike’s passion is to see people connect with Christ as they grow closer to one another.  As a co-founding pastor of The Grove, Mike has a passion to see growth in people who were disconnected from God, and have now discovered what it means to be in relationship with the One who created them.  Mike believe that Jesus changes everything, and encourages our families at The Grove to be involved in spiritual growth through small groups and in every aspect of their daily lives.

The Grove Community Church Leadership Team

At the Grove, we elect a portion of our leadership team every year to represent our congregation and to partner with our pastors to see the Kingdom grow in our community.  Our church leadership consists of incredible people who desire to grow in their relationship with Jesus by leading others, who are involved in reaching the people in their community, and who lead through the example of their character.  Contact the Leadership HERE.  

I thought the name above the bio could be the contact link for the emails.

******** What to expect *********

Welcome to The Grove Community Church! We believe you
belong here and we are glad that you are exploring our site.
We would love to meet you in person at 10:15 AM on Sunday
mornings, or online at facebook.com/grovecommunity. This is
the best page to plan your first weekend worship experience at
The Grove. If you would like to know more about what we
believe, our values, and meet our leadership team, please feel
free to search this site, or contact us with the information below!
We are looking forward to a chance to experience worship with
you, because we believe YOU BELONG HERE!
What should I wear?
We want you to feel comfortable. After all, we are thrilled that
you're joining us and want you to be more focused on the
service than what you're wearing. We are a laid back church
with a come as you are atmosphere.
When are services?
We currently offer a worship experience on Sundays at 10:15
AM. If you are early, you will not be disappointed as you will
have a chance to interact with great people, check your children
in to our children’s room, and enjoy some GREAT coffee on us!
Where do I park?
Because of our downtown location at The Grove (116 S. Main
Sheet in Independence, OR), we often get the question of
where to park. We have a fairly large space behind the church,
and we also encourage street parking in front of the church in
the few blocks around our downtown location.
Where do I enter?
Our entrance is right off main street in front of our location.
There will be an open door and a friendly face to help you find
your way when you join us. Look for our logo on our front
windows, and for our signs along the street!
Where do my kids go?
We have children's ministries for kids from birth up to 5th
grade. There is a place to check in at the entrance to our
children’s room. We encourage you to come a little early to
check your kids in to the nursery. Nursery is provided for the
length of the service. Kid’s are checked in before service, but
will sit with you until released after the music (we love to have
families sing together), and they will have a message aimed
right at them done by some amazing volunteers!
How do I get more connected?
We would love for you to fill out our “next steps” card available
on the seat backs of the chairs in the sanctuary. Please take a
moment to fill out the connection portion of the card, and we
hope you take a moment to fill out the “next steps” side of the
card to share with us the work God is doing in your life so we
can be a part of your journey!
